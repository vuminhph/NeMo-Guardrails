# Getting Detailed Logging Information with Output Variables

Begin by importing `nemoguardrails` and setting the path to your config

```python
from nemoguardrails import LLMRails, RailsConfig
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()

# Adjust your config path to your configuration!
config_path = "examples/bots/abc/"
```

## Load the config and set up your rails

```python
config = RailsConfig.from_path(config_path)
rails = LLMRails(config)
```

## Set your output variables and run generation
Once your rails app is set up from the config, you can set your output variables via the the `options` keyword argument in `LLMRails.generate`.
This is set up as a dictionary that allows fine-grained control over your LLM generation.
Setting the `output_vars` generation option will record information about the context of your generation.
As messages are sent, additional information will be stored in context variables.
You can either specify a list of `output_vars` or set it to `True` to return the complete context.

```python
messages=[{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Hello! What can you do for me?"
}]

options = {"output_vars": True}

output = rails.generate(messages=messages, options=options)
```

```python
print(output)
```

```

```

## Setting specific options

As we can see, the amount of information logged is significant when using `output_vars=True` is significant.
Let's say that we are only interested in whether any input or output rails are triggered.
In that case, we can set `output_vars` to `["triggered_input_rail", "triggered_output_rail"]`

```python
messages=[{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Who is the president of the ABC company and when were they born?"
}]

options = {"output_vars": ["triggered_input_rail", "triggered_output_rail"]}

output = rails.generate(messages=messages, options=options)
```

```python
print(output)
```

```
response=[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "I'm sorry, I can't respond to that."}] llm_output=None output_data={'triggered_input_rail': 'self check input', 'triggered_output_rail': None} log=None
```

## Accessing our output vars

As we can see, providing a list of output vars dramatically reduces the amount of data logged.
We can access the data of interest by accessing the elements of the generated response.

```python
output.output_data
```

```yaml
{'triggered_input_rail': 'self check input', 'triggered_output_rail': None}
```

```python
output.response
```

```
[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "I'm sorry, I can't respond to that."}]
```

## Getting Additional Detailed Logging Information

In addition to the `output_vars` option, there is also a `log` generation option that can be set.
This includes four different inner options to log:
* `activated_rails`
* `llm_calls`
* `internal_events`
* `colang_history`

We saw in our previous request that the `'self check input'` rail was triggered -- let's log detailed information about the rails that were activated during the previous generation.

```python
messages=[{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Who is the president of the ABC company and when were they born?"
}]

options = {
    "output_vars": ["triggered_input_rail"],
    "log": {
        "activated_rails": True
    }
}

output = rails.generate(messages=messages, options=options)
```

```python
print(output)
```

```

```

Here we can observe that a number of items are logged:
* The type and name of the activated rail
* The colang decisions made
* The executed actions, their parameters and return values
* Any calls made to an LLM including time information, number of tokens, prompt, completion, and the raw response data.

From the above, we clearly see that the self check rail checked whether the user's prompt complied with the company policy and decided that it was not a question that could be answered.
As a point of comparison, let's look at the log information for a simple greeting.

```python

    "role": "user",
    "content": "Hello! What can you do for me?"
}]

options = {
    "output_vars": ["triggered_input_rail"],

        "activated_rails": True
    }
}

output = rails.generate(messages=messages, options=options)
```

```python
print(output.log)
```

Here we see that the self check input rail is still being activated, but the rail decides that the message should not be blocked. If we look at the remainder of the log, we can see that the bot moves on to generate the user intent and upon assessing it, performs retrieval, generation, self check of the output, and then returns the message to the user.

```python
print(output.log.activated_rails[-4].decisions,
      output.log.activated_rails[-3].decisions,
      output.log.activated_rails[-2].decisions,
      output.log.activated_rails[-1].decisions
     )
